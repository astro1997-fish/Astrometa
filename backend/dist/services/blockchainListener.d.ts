/**
 * Ethereum blockchain listener for AstroPaymentReceiver contract events.
 * Watches for PaymentReceived events, matches them to pending transactions,
 * and atomically credits user balances after sufficient confirmations.
 *
 * Safety properties:
 *  - Idempotent: uses conditional status update (pending → confirmed) so
 *    replayed events or multi-instance races never double-credit.
 *  - Finality-guarded: waits MIN_CONFIRMATIONS blocks before crediting to
 *    protect against chain reorgs.
 *  - Deduplication: processed (txHash + logIndex) pairs are persisted so
 *    restarts cannot replay an already-handled event.
